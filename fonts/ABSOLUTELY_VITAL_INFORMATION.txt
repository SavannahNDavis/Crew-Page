Jack Pirate is a hand-drawn blackletter typeface, created by Måns Grebäck during 2019. 

It is a genuine medieval font with fraktur-inspired letter forms, Gothic decoratives 
and a mysterious undertone. 

Use it for projects relating to the Middle Ages, or in modern contexts such as tattoo or 
storefront graphics. 

It contains an alternate alphabet, to be used as a stand-alone font or to give decoration 
and variation to the regular style. 
The font is multilingual and has an extensive range of glyphs; it supports all Latin-based
European languages, contains numbers as well as all symbols and characters you'll ever need.
